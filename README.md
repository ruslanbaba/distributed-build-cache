# Distributed Build Cache System

Enterprise-grade Bazel remote cache implementation on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Cloud Storage backend.

## Architecture Overview

This system provides a high-performance, scalable remote build cache for Bazel builds, specifically optimized for iOS development teams. The architecture leverages:

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** for container orchestration
- **Google Cloud Storage** for artifact storage backend
- **Go-based cache service** with intelligent pruning logic
- **gRPC** for high-performance communication
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring and observability
- **Istio** service mesh for security and traffic management

## Key Features

- âš¡ **70% build acceleration** for iOS builds
- ðŸ’° **$12k/month storage cost savings** through intelligent cache pruning
- ðŸ”’ **Enterprise security** with Workload Identity and RBAC
- ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive monitoring** with metrics and alerting
- ðŸš€ **Auto-scaling** based on workload demand
- ðŸ”„ **Multi-region support** for global teams

## Performance Metrics

- Supports 200+ concurrent mobile developers
- Sub-100ms cache hit latency
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automatic cache eviction and lifecycle management

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy to GKE
make deploy-staging
make deploy-production

# Monitor system health
make monitor

# Run tests
make test-all
```

## Cost Optimization

The intelligent cache pruning system reduces storage costs by:
- Implementing LRU eviction policies
- Analyzing build patterns and usage statistics
- Automatic cleanup of stale artifacts
- Compression and deduplication strategies
