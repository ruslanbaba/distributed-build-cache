# Distributed Build Cache System

Enterprise-grade Bazel remote cache implementation on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Cloud Storage backend.

## Architecture Overview

This system provides a high-performance, scalable remote build cache for Bazel builds, specifically optimized for iOS development teams. The architecture leverages:

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** for container orchestration
- **Google Cloud Storage** for artifact storage backend
- **Go-based cache service** with intelligent pruning logic
- **gRPC** for high-performance communication
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring and observability
- **Istio** service mesh for security and traffic management



## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy to GKE
make deploy-staging
make deploy-production

# Monitor system health
make monitor

# Run tests
make test-all
```

## Cost Optimization

The intelligent cache pruning system reduces storage costs by:
- Implementing LRU eviction policies
- Analyzing build patterns and usage statistics
- Automatic cleanup of stale artifacts
- Compression and deduplication strategies
