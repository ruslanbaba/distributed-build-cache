# Distributed Build Cache System on GKE

A production-grade, enterprise-level Bazel remote cache implementation running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) backend. This system accelerates iOS builds supporting developers while implementing intelligent cache pruning logic. 

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Build acceleration** for iOS builds through intelligent caching
- **Storage cost savings** via smart cache pruning
- **Enterprise security** with Workload Identity, RBAC, and mTLS
- **GKE Autopilot** for reduced operational overhead
- **Helm-based deployment** for production-ready orchestration
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger
- **GitOps ready** with ArgoCD integration
- **SBOM generation and container signing** for supply chain security
- **Multi-environment support** (dev, staging, production)

## 📋 Prerequisites

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI authenticated and configured
- Required tools:
  ```bash
  # macOS installation
  brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
  brew install terraform kubectl helm cosign trivy go
  ```

## Cost Optimization

The intelligent cache pruning system reduces storage costs by:
- Implementing LRU eviction policies
- Analyzing build patterns and usage statistics
- Automatic cleanup of stale artifacts
- Compression and deduplication strategies
