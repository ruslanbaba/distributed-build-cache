#### 8. GitHub Actions Improvements
- **Dedicated workflows** for different components (infra, pruner, bazel-remote)
- **Security scanning integration** (Gosec, Trivy, CodeQL)
- **Artifact management** with proper caching
- **Environment-based deployments** with approval gates

### üìä Monitoring & Observability

#### 9. Enhanced Metrics
- **Comprehensive pruning metrics** (efficiency, duration, errors)
- **Cache performance metrics** (hit rates, latency)
- **Resource utilization tracking** for cost optimization
- **SLO/SLI implementation** for production readiness

#### 10. Sample Project Integration
- **Complete Bazel workspace** for testing cache functionality
- **iOS-optimized configuration** examples
- **Performance testing capabilities** with example builds
- **Documentation for developers** on cache integration

### üöÄ Production Readiness

#### 11. Multi-Environment Support
